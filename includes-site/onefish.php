    <p>
        This one has a little star.<br />
        This one has a little car.<br />
        Say! What a lot<br />
        Of fish there are.
    </p>
    <p>
        Yes. Some are red. And some are blue.<br />
        Some are old. And some are new.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some are sad.<br />
        And some are glad.<br />
        And some are very, very bad.
    </p>
    <p>
        Why are they<br />
        Sad and glad and bad?<br />
        I do not know.<br />
        Go ask your dad.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some are thin.<br />
        And some are fat.<br />
        The fat one has<br />
        A yellow hat.
    </p>
    <p>
        From there to here, from here to there,<br />
        Funny things<br />
        Are everywhere. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Here are some<br />
        Who like to run.<br />
        They run for fun<br />
        In the hot, hot sun.
    </p>
    <p>
        Oh me! Oh my!<br />
        Oh me! Oh my!<br />
        What a lot<br />
        Of funny things go by.

        Some have two feet<br />
        And some have four.<br />
        Some have six feet<br />
        And some have more.
    </p>
    <p>
        Where do they come from? I can’t say.<br />
        But I bet they have come a long, long way.
    </p>
    <p>
        We see them come.<br />
        We see them go.<br />
        Some are fast.<br />
        And some are slow.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some are high<br />
        And some are low.<br />
        Not one of them<br />
        Is like another.<br />
        Don’t ask us why.<br />
        Go ask your mother.
    </p>

        Look at his fingers!<br />
        One, two, three…<br />

        Five, six, seven,<br />
        Eight, nine, ten.<br />
        He has eleven!

        Eleven, too!
