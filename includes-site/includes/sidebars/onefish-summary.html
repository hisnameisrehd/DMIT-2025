<p>One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish is, at first glance, a book of silly and enchanting rhymes and… not much else. But don't write it off yet.</p>
<p>Sure, the plot doesn't travel in a straight line like that of many fairy tales and children's books. Instead, it meanders from the beginning—where we meet with a motley assortment of fish—to the rest of the book, where we travel with a girl and a boy as they point out new creatures and their zany collection of pets. Plus, it's got a bonus—a side plot involving a rather crotchety creature named Ned. His sections may as well be titled, "The Trials and Tribulations of Ned and His Bed" for all the complaining that he does.</p>
