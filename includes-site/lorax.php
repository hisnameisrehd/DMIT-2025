<h1 style="text-align: center;">The Lorax<br />By Dr. Seuss</h1>
<p>
    At the far end of town where the Grickle-grass grows and the wind smells slow-and-sour when it blows and no
    birds ever sing excepting old crows... is the Street of the Lifted Lorax.
</p>
<p>
    And deep in the Grickle-grass, some people say, if you look deep enough you can still see, today, where the
    Lorax once stood just as long as it could before somebody lifted the Lorax away.
</p>
<p>
    What was the Lorax? Any why was it there? And why was it lifted and taken somewhere from the far end of
    town where the Grickle-grass grows? The old Once-ler still lives here.
</p>
<p>Ask him, he knows.</p>
<p>
    You won't see the Once-ler. Don't knock at his door. He stays in his Lerkim on top of his store. He stays in his
    Lerkim, cold under the floor, where he makes his own clothes out of miff-muffered moof. And on special dank
    midnights in August, he peeks out of the shutters and sometimes he speaks and tells how the Lorax was lifted
    away. He'll tell you, perhaps... if you're willing to pay.
</p>
<p>
    On the end of a rope he lets down a tin pail and you have to toss in fifteen cents and a nail and the shell of a
    great-great-great- grandfather snail.
</p>
<p>
    Then he pulls up the pail, makes a most careful count to see if you've paid him the proper amount. Then he
    hides what you paid him away in his Snuvv, his secret strange hole in his gruvvulous glove. Then he grunts. I
    will call you by Whisper-ma-Phone, for the secrets I tell you are for your ears alone.
</p>
<p>
    SLUPP Down slupps the Whisper-ma-Phone to your ear and the old Once-ler's whispers are not very clear,
    since they have to come down through a snergelly hose, and he sounds as if he had smallish bees up his nose.
    Now I'll tell you, he says, with his teeth sounding gray, how the Lorax got lifted and taken away... It all started
    way back... such a long, long time back...
</p>
<p>
    Way back in the days when the grass was still green and the pond was still wet and the clouds were still clean,
    and the song of the Swomee-Swans rang out in space... one morning, I came to this glorious place. And I first
    saw the trees! The Truffula Trees! The bright-colored tufts of the Truffula Trees! Mile after mile in the fresh
    morning breeze.
</p>
<p>
    And under the trees, I saw Brown Bar-ba-loots frisking about in their Bar-ba-loot suits as the played in the
    shade and ate Truffula Fruits. From the rippulous pond came the comfortable sound of the Humming-Fish
    humming while splashing around.
</p>
<p>
    But those trees! Those trees! Those Truffula Trees! All my life I'd been searching for trees such as these. The
    touch of their tufts was much softer than silk. And they had the sweet smell of fresh butterfly milk. 
</p>
<p>
    I felt a great leaping of joy in my heart. I knew just what I'd do! I unloaded my cart. In no time at all, I had built
    a small shop. Then I chopped down a Truffula Tree with one chop. And with great skillful skill and with great
    speedy speed, I took the soft tuft. And I knitted a Thneed!
</p>
<p>
    The instant I'd finished I heard a ga-Zump! I looked. I saw something pop out of the stump of the tree I'd
    chopped down. It was sort of a man. Describe him...That's hard. I don't know if I can. He was shortish, and
    oldish, and brownish and mossy. And he spoke with a voice that was sharpish and bossy.
</p>
<p>
    Mister! He said with a sawdusty sneeze, I am the Lorax. I speak for the trees. I speak for the trees, for the trees
    have no tongues. And I'm asking you, sir, at the top of my lungs-- he was very upset as he shouted and puffed--
    What's that THING you've made out of my Truffula tuft?
